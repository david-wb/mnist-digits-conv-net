# MNIST Hand Written Digits CNN
This repo contains a jupyter notebook `train.ipynb` that trains a CNN model on the MNIST digits dataset.

# Getting Started
1. Install the python requirements:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. To train the model, launch the jupyter server with `jupyter notebook` and open `train.ipynb`
3. Trained model weights are saved in the repo. To start the inference server simply run `start.sh` and go to `localhost:5000` in your browser. You can use the file `test.png` in this repo as an inference example.
